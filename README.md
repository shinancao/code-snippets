# code_collector

This repository will collect code segments that we frequently meet in interviews and need us to implement it, or that can be applied to our daily coding. I'll comment the key points and provide test cases. Also I'll update this repository continuously, if this will help you, could you please give it a ‚≠ê? If you find something wrong, please also open an issue, thank you ~
