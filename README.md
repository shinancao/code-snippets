# code-snippets

This repository will collect code snippets that we frequently meet in interviews and need us to implement it, or that can be applied to our daily coding. 

I'll comment the key points and provide test cases. Also I'll update this repository continuously. So if you're interested in it, you could give it a star.

If you find something wrong or better solutions, please open issues, thank you ~
